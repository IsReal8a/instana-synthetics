# Instana - The Synthetics Chapter
All my "try and error" things for Synthetics in Instana.

The main purpose of this repo is to share with you, the reader, how can you talk with the Synthetics side of Instana.

## Talking with the API

That folder contains "from the cave" examples on how to use the [Synthetics OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#tag/Synthetic-Settings)

## Synthetic PoP Auto

Folder that contains the not so pretty ways to deploy a Point Of Presence in the Cloud.
